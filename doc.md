## What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open source tool developed by HashiCorp and their respective community. The tool itself is for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure in a safe, efficient, and repeatable way. Terraform does this through connection with providers, often developed for a by particular offerings such as Azure, AWS, and GCP, and can even work with custom in-house provider based solutions.

Terraform uses configuration files for the definition of resources to create. These resources make up what Terraform builds to run an entire data center, application, or related deployment. As the configuration is changed Terraform determines what differences are and creates incremental execution plans which can be applied.

...

The infrastructure Terraform can manage includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc.

Examples work best to showcase Terraform. Please see the use cases.

The key features of Terraform are:

### » Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

### » Execution Plans

Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.

### » Resource Graph

Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

### » Change Automation

Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.
